# EmoChat
This chatbot is based on sentiment analysis and GPT-2. It leverages pre-trained language models (LLMs) from Hugging Face and the OpenAI API for fine-tuning, offering a personalized conversation experience.

## Features
**Sentiment Analysis:** EmoChat analyzes the sentiment of your input and tailors its responses accordingly. Whether positive, negative, or neutral, EmoChat adapts to the emotional context of your messages.

**GPT-2 Language Model:** EmoChat utilizes the GPT-2 language model from Hugging Face to generate context-aware and coherent responses. The model understands the context of the conversation and responds in a manner consistent with the given input.

**Fine-Tuning with OpenAI API:** EmoChat further refines its responses using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API. This step ensures that the generated responses are contextually relevant, coherent, and finely tuned for a more natural conversation flow.
